			<h3>General Usage</h3>
			<h4>Clippy and it's ugly stepsister, the graphical interface for clippy</h4>
			<p>
			Clippy and the graphical interface for clippy both work on the data that's inside your clipboard. 
			The best way to interact with clippy is:
			</p>
			<p>
			Whatever editor you are currently working in, copy the text you wish to change.  Run one of the clippy
			commands and paste back into the application you were just working in.  The console version, if ran from
			a run prompt (Window key+R) will go away as soon as it's done, so you can immediately hit Ctrl+V to
			paste back into your application.  The graphical interface forces you to tab/click back to your
			original application. But hey, you like clicking that mouse a lot if you want the graphical interface,
			right?
			</p>
			<p>
			If you need help, ask for it. Either click the help menu, or type `clippy help`
			</p>	
	
			<h4>Manip</h4>
			<p>
			Manip is for you that know how awesome awk/sed/grep in \*nix are.  I **don't** promise that manip will
			do even a tenth of what those commands can do for you, but it **is** nice for a lot of purposes.  It will 
			handle your standard output stream and perform all the functions that clippy will do for your clipboard.
			Even the user defined functions.
			</p>
			<p>
			Just pipe your output through manip and watch it output your text just the way you like it.
			</p>

			<h3>Specific Commands</h3>
			<p>
			The best documentation for specific commands inside of clippy is clippy itself.  You should first learn
			how to use `clippy help` and `clippy help [functionName]`
			<ol>
				<li>Cap - capitalizes or lower cases</li>
				<li>Chunk - splits text by number of characters</li>
				<li>ColumnAlign - Aligns tab delimited text into text-columns</li>
				<li>Count - Counts the number of characters or lines</li>
				<li>Dedupe - Deduplicates a list</li>
				<li>Encode - encode/decode xml/url/base64</li>
				<li>**Grep** - returns list of matches</li>
				<li>NewText - get a new GUID, or current date data</li>
				<li>**Rep** - replaces regex patterns or sql patterns</li>
				<li>Reverse - Reverses your text</li>
				<li>Snippet - Obtains a predefined snippet of text</li>
				<li>Sort - Sorts a list</li>
				<li>**Insert** - Copy your SQL output with headers and turn it into an  insert statement</li>
			<br />	<li>ToBase - Convert a base10 number to another base level (up to 36)</li>
				<li>Xml - Pretty print XML (or xml-esque or partial xml)</li>
				<li>Help - either print the list of functions, or specifics on a particular function if specified.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>User Defined Functions</h3>

			<p> 
			Very often, you will find yourself performing the same function or set of functions many times over.
			Save these to user defined functions.  For instance, if you find yourself removing empty lines more 
			than once, you can define a function that looks like:
			<br /></br />
			rep "\n{2,}" "\n"
    		<br /><br /> 
			You can call that "smash" and then you will be able to run a command `clippy smash` any time you wish.
			</p>
			<p>
			To quickly view/create/update some UDF's, just type in `clippy --udf`.  I then present you with a
			ugly windows form to make those.  Otherwise, you can modify your udf.xml file by hand.
			</p>
	<br />		
			<h3>Special Characters</h3>

			<p>
			Clippy has several "special" characters so it lives happily on the command-line.
			</p>
			<p>
			* \\q - A quotation mark (because quotation marks denote the end of a parameter on the command line)<br />
			* \\t - A tab<br />
			* \\n - A carriage return/line feed (don't worry about the \\r)<br />
