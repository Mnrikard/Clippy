# Clippy

Clippy is a set of tools to manipulate data.  It generally works on the text on your clipboard and will modify that text
and place it back on your clipboard.  You will be able to copy your text in *any* text editor, run clippy to modify 
that text, and then paste it right back into your editor with the modifications made.

### Utilities
#### Clippy

Clippy is the flagship product, it is ran from the command line (run box) and works on the text stored in your
clipboard.  The general syntax is `clippy [command] <parameter1> <parameter2>...`

#### ClippyUtility

ClippyUtility is a GUI product to satisfy users who are afraid of the command line.  Usage should be self-explanatory.
It also works on the text stored in your clipboard.

#### Manip 

Manip is a command line utility that doesn't read the text on your clipboard, it modifies the standard output stream
of your command line.  Usage is through the standard pipe command and would look like 

    $> echo "hello" | manip rep "h" "H"
    Hello
    $>

#### User Defined Functions

Oftentimes you will find yourself running a specific replace or a series of commands many times over.  One that often turns up is getting a comma separated list of all the numbers on your clipboard.  Clippy lets you define a user defined function for anything that you find yourself doing more than once.

`clippy --udf` will bring up a function editor, from which you can select previously ran commands, or enter new ones.
